## Introduction

Sail provides a Docker powered local development experience for Laravel that is compatible with macOS, Windows (WSL2), and Linux.

This library has taken that work and tailored it for a WordPress environment.

Other than Docker, no software or libraries are required to be installed on your local computer before using Sail. Sail's simple CLI means you can start building your Laravel application without any previous Docker experience.

#### Inspiration

WordPress Sail is inspired by and derived from [Laravel Sail](https://github.com/laravel/sail), which is inspired by and derived from [Vessel](https://github.com/shipping-docker/vessel) by [Chris Fidao](https://github.com/fideloper). If you're looking for a thorough introduction to Docker, check out Chris' course: [Shipping Docker](https://serversforhackers.com/shipping-docker).

## Official Documentation

WordPress Sail should be considered unstable and does not currently have docs. Documentation for Sail can be found on the [Laravel website](https://laravel.com/docs/sail).
